# Analyzing-Eye-Tracking-Data-of-Glaucoma-s-Patients

- Built ML model to identify glaucoma patients using 1.2k timestamps data of eye and ball trajectories in VR of 1k patients
- Experimented SVMs, Random Forests, NNs, RNNs and LSTM to achieve maximum 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 73%
- Implemented data cleaning, missing value handling and interpolation techniques to improve performance of model by 6%
