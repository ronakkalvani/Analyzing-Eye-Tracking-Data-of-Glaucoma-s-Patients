# Analyzing-Eye-Tracking-Data-of-Glaucoma-s-Patients

Built Machine learning model to classify glaucoma patient data with a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 62%.

Utilized ML Algorithms such as SVMs, decision trees, RNNs and LSTM to gain insight from patterns observed in time series data containing path of eyes and moving ball in VR for glaucoma’s patients and healthy controls

Implemented data cleaning, normalization and interpolation techniques to enhance the model’s performance
